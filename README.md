# practice-project-interactive-rating-component
 
Simple solution to [this challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This time I first tried the mobile first approach. This worked quite good, but the mobile view does not differ a lot from the desktop view in this challenge.
